1. Pairwise Correlation Matrix: Calculate pairwise correlations between the mean spectra of each category to see which are closely related. Higher correlations suggest similarity, while lower values indicate unique characteristics.

2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Use PCA to reduce dimensionality, then assess the variance explained by each component. Categories with similar spectral qualities will cluster in the reduced space, making it easier to visualize relationships.

3. Distribution Comparison: For each frequency bin, analyze the distribution of magnitudes across categories (e.g., Gaussianity, variance) to determine if specific bins are more or less variable per category.

4. Bayesian Classification: Use Bayesian inference on spectral features to model the probability of each category, which may highlight distinguishing characteristics in a probabilistic way.

5. Spectral Entropy: Calculate entropy for each frequency bin across categories. Lower entropy in certain bins might indicate unique, consistent features that differentiate a category.
